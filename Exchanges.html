            The NYSE is the world’s largest exchange, averaging $169 billion in trades per day. It has a listing of nearly 1,900 companies and has around 700 traders on the floor per day. On the 17th of May, 1792, the NYSE was created when 24 stock brokers signed the Buttonwood Agreement in New York City. They signed this agreement to bypass auctioneers and commission rates for products like wheat and tobacco. Their first headquarters were in a small coffee house. After 25 years, the NYSE was officially created, under the name ‘The New York Stock & Exchange Board’. They specialized in just bonds and bank stocks, but then started expanding in the early 1800s. Today, the NYSE is a Fortune 500 company and has a 21 room, trading floor located at 21 Wall Street, New York City, New York.
