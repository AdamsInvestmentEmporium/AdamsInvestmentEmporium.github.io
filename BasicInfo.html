    <div class="basicsexplanation">
        By the law of compounding interest, the longer that one has their money collecting interest, the more money they can accrue by the time of their retirement. Starting early allows one to put less money away up front because it can grow over a longer period, while later in life, the short time available until retirement requires a lot more money up front since it doesn’t have time to grow. If you were to do this, the money you put up front is the majority of the money that you will get back after claiming the investment.

        What is the relationship between risk and return
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="basicsexplanation">
        Risk and return are positively related. That is, as risk increases then return will also increase, while low risk investments often return very small amounts.

        What does it mean to be diversified?
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="basicsexplanation">
        To be diversified means to have your money in many different places. Instead of placing ‘all your eggs in one basket’. One should invest in a multitude of different stocks, bonds, and savings to ensure that they can’t lose all of their money if one company happens to fail.

        How does a person compute how much money he/she will need in retirement?
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="basicsexplanation">
        In order to calculate how much one needs to save for retirement, you need to first calculate your quality of life in the present moment, keeping in mind the dollar amount that this quality of life costs. After deciding whether you want to upgrade, downgrade, or remain the same from this certain quality of life, then you can calculate how much it will cost in the future. By using the average inflation rate per year (we can estimate this amount to be about 2 to 3% a year), we now know how much money that one year of retirement would cost. By multiplying that amount by how many years one plans to live in retirement, this is the expected amount that you would have to save.
