    <br />

    <div class="basicsexplanation">
        Black Tuesday, the day the Stock market crashed and 16 million shares were traded. This was the beginning of the Great Depression.

    <div class="basicsexplanation">
        Black Monday, stock markets crashed around the globe. It all started in Hong Kong and then spread to surrounding areas and eventually to the States. Many people believed that the cause of it was the increase in program trading, where computers rapidly bought and sold stocks in lumps of 15 to yield capital gain.

    <div class="basicsexplanation">
        The DOW dropped 555 points (7.2%) in one day, caused by failing Asian markets. Additionally, the NYSE had a circuit crash in the middle of the day to stop a selling spree, but it did not work.

    <br />
    <div class="basicsexplanation">
        The DOW dropped 778 points, the worst loss in history (until now!). This was the start of the Great Recession and was initiated by the White House failing to pass a bill to fix the trouble.

    </div>
    <div class="basicsexplanation">
        The DOW was raised by 936 points, the largest in its history. After the bear market taking a toll with its 778 point drop, the market once again turned around naturally to a bull market, with every index soaring. Despite the Great Recession, the stock markets still go through their cycles of prosperity and crashing.

        Google had the biggest increase any company has ever seen in one day, a total revenue increase of $65.1 billion. This was during the middle of a raging market, and Google was doing very well for itself at the time, so this is potentially a reason why Google rose so much.

        February 5th and 8th, 2018
    </div>
    <br />
    <div class="basicsexplanation">
        The DOW lossed 1175 points the first day and 1032 points the next. Despite being so significant, the causes of this were pretty natural. The stock market had been in a long bull market and people were wondering when it all would change, and on these two days, the market shifted into a bear market.
